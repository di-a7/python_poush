#  if else statement- multi lined statement, 
# boolean values ma operate, 
# conditional statement, 
# if condition is true then the statements are executed
#  if should be defined to start if else statement
#  can consist multiple elif statements
# elif and else should be used according to the requirement
# if, elif, else should be followed by colon(":") and indentation
# syntax:
# if condition:
#    statement 1

# a = 10
# b = 5
# if a < b:
#    print("B is greater")
# elif a == b:
#    print("A and B are equal.")
# elif a > b:
#    print("ABCDE")
# else:
#    print("A is greater")

# todo:
# get 2 number input from user
# compare 2 numbers and print which one is greater

# simple calculator
# get  2 numbers from user
# get a operator from user(+,-,*,/)
# if operator is + then add two numbers and show the output
# if operator is - then subtract two numbers and show the output
# if operator is * then multiply two numbers and show the output
# if operator is / then divide two numbers and show the output
